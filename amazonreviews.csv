0,2,"  Ok the DSLR Giant Canon have launched 1 more entry level DSLR. Actually i bought this camera for my friend. Does this camera worth 31K. Lets seePROS1.  Its easy to use2. Decent battery backup3. Live mode operation is not lagging.CONS1. While focusing the DSLR is making too much noise and its the kind of annoying that u will lose interest in taking photos.2. No shortcut or assigned button to change F stop (aperture). A manufacturer who is keeping dedicated button for changing the ISO have to thing about the importance of aperture.3. You can't change the focusing point by pressing the round dial in the system, if u press it some other setup will open up.4. The output image quality is actually not mind blowing.5. White balance- Use it if u want to take risk6. Main issue. If u use camera flash to snap a pic during focusing it will flicker like anything and it will annoy and irritate the subject7. Noise Noise Noise. Whatever low ISO you use noise will b there and when i went to service center to ask about this they were saying use a prime lens to get good output.I am a Nikon user i have Nikon D3400. I compared both cameras by taking same images with same settings in manual mode. The output from Nikon is better than Canon 1500D.In one word if want to push photography to next level from using a Point and Shoot or mobile camera to DSLR Or to learn the whole DSLR setting go for it (only with a mindset to change the camera in 1 or 2 years). As canon accessories are comparatively less costly than Nikon it wont create hole in ur pocket.I am not biased towards Nikon, i wrote wat i felt.Its not worth for money"
1,5,  Good camera for beginners.
2,5,"  Great camera. Perfect product for young budding photographer..... Useful for in-house, nature, functions, and spare time photography. Take high quality pics, videos , portrait, landscape wildlife, nature pics etc"
3,5,"  Really impressed with Amazon surprise for delivering within the 2 nd day from ordered Really packing was excellent and the quality of the material is awesome love to control the camera from mobile through Wi-Fi easy to connect, best one for taking self photos and group pics also the quality of canon speaks everything dont go for any oscillation beginners blindly got for it"
4,1,"  You are on your own if you buy this product because canon local service center is of no help even in providing the product demo. We logged the complain on canon India site and not bothered to reply. Amazon call raised its hand saying ""proof of non service"" from local service center. So we have a DSLR that is producing blur images and canon is not providing any proper service. stay away"
5,1,  Request for replacement of camera main body  There is lot of blackspot/blackness automatically appears in View finder mirror just after 15 days.It is requested to please replace the camera as soon as possible.Awaiting early reply.Regards.
6,2,  I have received my product DSLR Cannon 1500D at 15 the October 2018 . But Adopter has not been given along with the DSLR which is a very common accessories.They must deliver that as soon as possible.Otheewise I gave to complain about it again & again.
7,3,"  Auto focus is not at all perfect.Minimum aperture is 4.5, so dont expect much in portrait.While focusing manually there is a play for the lense(18-55 mm) so that there is a chance for getting missing ur focus even though if ur made it correctly.Easy to operate compared to Nikkon models.Fast moving subjects cannot be captured as expected due to its poor auto focus performance. It take about 3 to 6 seconds to focus in internal lighting conditions and it fail to focus several times in dim lights.Plastic quality is poor.I got it for Rs.18599. So that it is a value for money product. Don't go for this model if ur willing to pay about 23k. Better go with Nikkon 5300."
8,4,  If you want to upgrade your camera from point and shoot to a dslr then it is a good camera for you but if you want to start videography then don't buy it auto focus of video is too much bad. If you want  a camera for videography then go foe canon 200D or Nikon D5600
9,5,"  I am really fully content with the product. It reached me within two days with everything  content in it and no doubt in a very good condition. It may be somewhat difficult for the beginners but it will not take a long to learn. If you are choosing between canon and Nikon I will suggest you canon because of its real colour capturing and fine focus of its lenses. You can get more slightly more features in Nikon than canon at the same price but that doesn't mean that will surely better than canon. You can look for contrast between canon and Nikon in the internet. I think it will suggest you the same""canon""."
10,5,"  I bought this camera with absolutely no knowledge about aperature, iso, shutter speed, etc.1. This camera is very user friendly. The knobs with explanation on screen is easy to understand. I got some great pics with auto mode and that encouraged me to take more pics.2. The difference of 9 vs 11 auto focus might be apparent if you have used camera with 11 AF points. For me, 9 was good enough as they are centered in middle of screen. In some occasions where we want to focus on birds, objects near rear of screen, manual focus need to be done. Otherwise AF points are excellent.3. In built flash is as good as we hope for. For nearby objects, flash is bright and pictures look great. Typewriter pic is taken during night time.4. Battery is awesome. Canon promised 500 photos. I guess that's enough for normal user. Agreed Nikon gives 1500 pics but I considered availability and cost factor and went for canon. I have been using it everyday from date of purchase and I have charged the battery once a week max. Really it's not like phone battery to charge at end of the day.5. Picture quality in auto mode is mind blowing. Smartphone all look like toy when using DSLR. With all hype of 64 MP, 108 MP camera in phone, I thought DSLR will just give similar results. Oh boy! I was wrong. Canon portrait pics are many many levels above best smartphone camera pics.6. I got it with 18-55 mm kit lens. Unless you like to take pics of objects in home and going to use it for taking portrait pics or family outing, this lens is not sufficient to enjoy DSLR. I very strongly urge you to go for 250 mm lens(70-300 mm may be but 250mm is best).7. Canon image cloud option is very useful. Unfortunately I am not able to upload high quality images-- image size reduces to less than 1 MB during upload. Nevertheless, that option is good.8. Taking video is pain and it drains battery. This is apt for taking still photos. Also video is restricted to 30 minutes.9. There are dedicated modes for macro, sports, landscape, food, etc. They just have right settings like higher aperature for landscape etc to get best shot.10. Learn photos editing software and get one. I thought they were bogus but it turns out you definitely need them.No need to buy UV lens protection. Get a tripod. Also good memory card. A hood. Good camera bag. You are ready to enter into world of DSLR and definitely canon motivates you to do more."
11,1,"  Amazon was dispatched this camera on 08.10.2019 at home and i went to some official trip on that time hence i was not able to check its operation. I came home on 23.10.2019 and opened this product, captured some images and it was good. Later i tried to transfer the images from Camera to mobile through Wifi and found the camera getting switched off. I tried several times and the problem remain same. Further i tried to return the camera and the seller is not accepting my request as the date of return is already crossed.I have contacted my friends who is working in photo studio regarding this and they have expressed that the Canon EOS 1500D is having such types of problem and we have seen many of the cameras having such problems.We request buyers who is willing to buy this product, pls avoid online purchases of this product. Verify before purchasing.Now i request Amazon to help us regarding this issue."
12,5,"  First of all thanks Amazon for giving such a wonderful offer , my dream comes true and finally I have dslr....Picture quite is awesome in both day light as well as low light. Still learning the different modes of camera for taking pictures. For beginners it's little difficult to handle but there is an auto mode  that can be used if you don't understand anything. But quality of pic comes better when you set the camera manually"
13,5,  I have purchased this for my brother last year from Amazon.I got the single kit. slightly disappointed due to that. Otherwise....*Excellent DSLR for beginners.*Easy to use.*Good quality.*Decent battery backup.*Worth for moneyFact: If your expectations are high with the stabilization or photo output etc then please go for Canon 5D/7D. This is for beginners (21K) and so if you buy this then keep your expectations as much you pay. :p :)
14,5,"  Let me explain.Yes, with 9 point AF with the OVF, you'll feel the AF a bit dated but does the job rather well. Live view has face detect but has a jerky continuous AF and is slow.But those are most of its negatives.The camera takes wonderful pictures and with digic 4+ image processor, the jpegs are perfectly usable. If you want perfection, shooting in RAW will give you what you need.The colors captured on this camera are perfect and natural, with settings to tweak them to your taste (see picture settings in menu).The build quality is solid and ergonomics of the camera, especially through its grip is wonderful. It feels perfect in my hands. The menu system is uncluttered and quite intuitive. It is very easy to customize the camera to your specific needs.You can shoot videos with this camera but without continuous AF, you'll get better results if you switch to manual focus during video.Why is it the best DSLR?Because of it's limitations in AF and simple straightforward usability it lets you take control over your photographs and videos unlike other advanced models which take control away from you and makes the choices for you. The result is you can get the exact photograph you intended to take. Combined with the 24 megapixel sensor, which is the same sensor found in almost all other canon APSC DSLRs, all the way upto 80D, the image quality is at par with much more expensive cameras.The digic 4+ processor is good for image processing, frankly the more advanced processors bring features such as 4K and such, which if you're not into video, you'll not miss it. The digic 4+ processor is more than adequate for your photography needs.With all the above considerations, it's the best DSLR you could get, in my opinion."
15,5,"  I had only 3 hours to make the decision. Next day I had my flight to Korea and we thought of buying a DSLR at night (didn't make a decision earlier, as we had One+ and iPhone which are kind of best in class for the camera). So, I quickly did research and found just 3-4 options. I watched 2-3 YouTube videos to make the final call and guess what I made the right choice. I took next day morning delivery paying 50 rs extra. The camera is superb (5 stars). Though I handled a Sony camera earlier, this is my first DSLR and believe me, it was quite easy to follow their instructions manual. I would highly recommend you to read the manual / try at home/rehearsal before you go out to capture actual pictures. I am attaching a few pics which I captured with just 2 hours of the experiment."
16,1,  The battery is faulty .... It drains even when not in use
17,1,  This amazon playing very cheap games to the customers. I have ordered this product on 29th for almost 29k and now the sale daybits cost around 23k. How fooling the customers for this kind of false pricings and every product has 10days return policy but now its not acceptable reurns it accepts only replacement. What a cheap gameplay amazon. If you really think about the customer do some promising thing not such kind of fraud things. Never ever i buyer in amazon again. Good bye. You lost a loyal customer. I may not do anything for you except stop ordering from you. That enough to added advantage to your competitors.
18,5,  Got it at 18990/- only during the great india n sale. Picture quality is great. Battery backup is about to take 500 shots. Flash is just ok. Not a sharp one. Very handy and easy to use. If you want to buy then buy with dual lense because 2nd lense is about 12 to 14k. In dual kit you get 2nd lense at 8 to 9k
19,5,"  WARRANTY CAN BE REGISTERED!! IT HAS 2 YRS WARRANTY!!!Just finished registering the camera and lens.Great camera. You will love it. Very steady. Great buy to start your hobby/profession. Don't compare to other cameras. At 26k good its a great dslr with 2yrs warranty. Should take care of parties, weddings and video shoots. Excellent battery life. The camera case is good.It has no external mic in."
20,5,  It's a great product but the price fluctuates between 24k to 30.5 k which is a big difference.I have even found PPL buying it for 20.5 k .So please wait for the offers to make it a real value for money deal.The add on lens should come with more affordable packages.
21,4,  Picture quality fantastic and camera handling and features are very good which will attract a beginner.
22,1,  I wanted to return this order on the same day and purchase Canon 200D as I did not like it.. but never had an option to do that. Tried contacting CX care a number times and nobody were of any help to me. Atlease got a chance to ask for assistance regarding the return. I still have it packed as it is.. I am not at all happy with the product and have not even charged the battery even once.
23,5,"  Excellent camera for both beginners and advance users, 24.1 Mp gets your pictures crystal clear. I suggest to get this deal before it ends"
24,5,"  Amazing product, got 1+1 extended warranty. Using it for a while- working good and got the product in clean and sealed condition.Pros:1.amazing picture quality2. Handy3.light weight4.gripping is good5. Best features with WiFi and nfc,can transfer images directly to phone or pc. 6. Memory card and one battery is includedCons:1. Camera carrying bag is small2. No extra battery with package you have buy extra one for backup3. Don't come with screen protector, you have to buy it for LCD  display protection from scratches."
25,3,"  I bought this camera, its was working well with 18-55 lens, but when i move to 55-255 the performance was low.battery backup also very less.But overall good camera. At night 55-255 lens take hell alot time to focus.So my suggestion is go for 200D. Amazon wont refund for it, so i sell the camera on OLX"
26,1,"  First of all. I ordered this product in Amazon great sale at 34000, but next day the price was 30000. I am very disappointed with it. Camera is for beginners, who wants to learn about basic photography. It's for casual use. If you want a proper professional camera for photography, then I would suggest go for 70d or further."
27,1,  Delivery boy not calling for pick up the product as I returned the item
28,1,  This is a review about the seller ... Please think twice before you purchase anything from this seller ... The camera I had recieved was not seal packed ... It had a tape to give the illusion... And the camera had a very very light scratch on the screen and these were some of the red alerts and bingo there came the real issue ... The menu button was faulty ...
29,2,  Camera is gud one..... But i brought it on 'no cost emi (970.86)' of 6months @25376.14 after the deduction of 970.86. Now my EMI is 4391.16 for 6months...that comes 26346.96...So my question is how will i get the no cost benefit of 970.86?
30,1,  I have purchased this Canon DSLR after a small research. It's results were fantastic as a digital camera. But just after few months of purchase I found that sometimes it's shutter starts operating automatically without clicking any picture. Sometimes it worked ok but sometimes automatically opening and closing of shutter with annoying noice started. Then I contacted Canon serice centre. They gave me address of local service centre at Jabalpur MP. I gave them my camera for repairing. They sent it to Indore city workshop and it took nearly one and half month to return me. It was working ok at that time but after few days that shutter problem started again.Now I can not give this camera to workshop again and again so I am using this faulty camera as sometimes it works ok but sometimes it doesn't work due to shutter problem.I thought earlier that Canon was excellent brand but now my thinking is totally changed about it.
31,5,"  # DSLR at feasible price# Excellent picture quality#Sturdy body with ergonomic design which is easy to grasp# Compatible with accessory lens like tele zoom lens and macro lens (which are not a part of standard lens kit)#Easy to operate#Fairly good battery life#Easy connectivity with multiple options- wireless, USB,HDMI etc"
32,1,  This camera is only for photography ...u can't record a good video... because it doesn't have continuous autofocus while video recording....even mobile phones have that function.... the auto focus is fixed while video recording...like if u move in your video..then u get out of focus...which is disgusting.. because video means a movie a moving object...
33,5,"  This is my first camera. The pictures are great. Video quality is acceptable for such a mid level cost. The images are high resolution and good even in low light. Same for videos.For beginners like me,it takes a few weeks just to learn various settings like auto and manual focus. Aperture and shutter.. and ISO...Youtube is very useful for first time user to get familiar with the settings.The seller was very nice. Delivery was good and product was authentic,as always!The quality is good with free bag and a 16 GB sd card,but had to buy 128 gb as 16 gb is low space for a camera that takes high resolution images and videos.Just go for it."
34,3,"  The product is absolutely perfect but Amazon service is not professional. Don't buy this if you are going to shoot videos bcoz it doesn't support mic, Amazon will not tell you this in their description of product. I lost my 10k because of Amazon they mention ""10 days returnable"" but it is actually ""10 day exchangeable"". They totally denied to take it back. Be careful when you are buying it."
35,5,"  Candid pics, excellent picture clarity best in this price you can't ask for more. Great cam for first DSLR folks.The disappointment is only with the Courier service, have been very pathetic service with Amazon delivery and it's been so worst since a couple of months recently. Amazon should rethink of the Courier partner. Will be a big drawback with this worst way of the delivery service ."
36,5,  Canon 1500 is the best entry level DSLR and its very easy and convenient to use..the canon connect app is jst superb.. u dnt have to worry abt transfering the pics from the memory card..jst connect the DSLR through its inbuilt wifi to ur smartphone and jst view or download any pic..save it in ur phone..laptop... u can also view and click from ur smartphone..this is the best function of the camera..the DSLR works well even in low light..i have tried clicking pics without using flash..and they came out superb..images are crisp and there is no issue of the pixelisation..day time images are superb no doubt..
37,5,  For beginners this is a great optionGo for it if you are learning basics of photographyImage quality is decentLow light photography you have to control on ownRest all covered
38,2,  I used it only 4 or 5 times till now and it’s not working properly.i was thinking that it might be setting problem but no it’s not a setting problem when I press the click button it stuck and on the screen it always show busy or error. I got frustrated when I pick it up for clicking pictures. With this problem first I have to switched it off and then on then it work only for 1 click after it again it show busy and the click button not work even I m not able to press it . It gets jam all the time.kindly do the needful bcz it’s in still warranty.
39,3,  This is my first DSLR. I will mention few points below which i liked and sumthing i didnt liked.LIKED:1) Its good for day time photography2) its lightweight3) Its good for normal photography4) 55 - 250mm lens very good for bokey effectDISLIKED:1) Kit lens not so good2) Flash too bright3) Night time photo not good.4) Quality feels average5) photo quality average
40,5,"  The camera is an excellent option for those who are just newly stepping into photography field as it can give them all the tools needed to develop their skills.Performance as an entry-level camera is good. It has Wifi inbuilt in so the users can transfer their files from the camera to smart devices..  Canon1500D has a  superior sensor over the older EOS 1300D  Thus, overall image quality is much better. Color saturation is decent and a fair amount of sharpness , As far as noise is concerned, the camera handles shots well up to ISO 1600 with a little amount of grains Even at ISO 800, the noise levels are acceptable. Increasing  ISO to 1600 increases the noise but the images were still good enough to be shared on social medias. Autofocus is fast enough when using the viewfinder but once switch to Live View mode and it really struggles to get the focus.  Overall i would recommend the camera to anyone who is starting into photography .Here are a few of my shots clicked using this camera."
41,5,"  This is my first camera and I'm extremely happy with my choice. It is just the right DSLR for a beginner. The displayed instruction for every function helps you to navigate yourself through them. Within a day or two you will know everything about it. It has a really fast auto focus and the picture quality is absolutely stunning. Being a beginner, I feel that I couldn't have chosen a better one."
42,5,"  I got it on the next day. Awesome product. Everything is good.Easy to handle, picture quality is very good. Good for your learning phase."
43,1,  I am using this for couple of months. In this model Canon has removed the center pin in Hot Shoe. Hence most of cheaper after market external Speedlight flashes cannot be used in this DSLR model. Very few models can be used which are TTL capable - but those are above 4K INR. So anyone looking to buy this please be prepared to invest in costly Canon or third party Speedlight Flashes. Inbuilt Flash is of no use.
44,4,"  For a DSLR, it is relatively compact, light in weight and easy to operate. Although certainly a step up from a smartphone, it’s just not all that exciting or satisfying to use for anyone with a deep interest in photography. Build quality is good enough to withstand normal usage, although not rough treatment and neither the camera nor the lens is weatherproof. The kit lens is an average performer across its focal length range. I'd recommend paying extra for stabilisation if you add a telephoto lens to the basic package.It lacks in some features, especially with the 30fps recording, 9-point focus system and the lack of a headphone jack, but if you are into photography, the camera makes up for it with the still great picture quality and amazing battery life for its price. I doubt it would provide the best stepping stone for beginners who want to improve their mastery of photography."
45,5,"  This is hands down, best entry level camera for regular use.  Begin with auto mode (auto focus, auto flash everything auto). Explore and learn slowly on your own or by watching some videos on youtube, and become an expert in no time. Once you become professional, you can be the photographer at your own wedding. All the best"
46,5,  This is my first ever DSLR and this is been a great experience pictures are so great that I gained a professional confidence that I can click good pictures thanks  to cannon for introducing such a great entry level DSLR at this affordable price by Amazone.Battery is also long lasting and very easy to use.i must suggest everyone who is looking for an entry level DSLR please go for this.
47,4,  M writing this review after usage of 1.5 years of canon1500D:-The camera is good - only for new comers into photography.. If you’re a photographer who does paid shoot or is interested in various amounts of genre in photography then I suggest to go with a lil high budget of another camera. This camera is good only with 50MM lens.. if you click pictures with the 18-55 MM lens then you are gonna definitely face issues with Noise in the picture.. same if you use 55-250 there is a high chance if getting shaken images also adding noise into it..if u have budget issues and are very good with post processing skills then you can go for it or else not..Overall:-Picture Quality:- 3Auto Focus:- 4Battery life:- 5
48,5,  Absolute value for money at 23500 (price I purchased for)Has a 24 MP lens with the latest in-class sensors and controls and even enhanced options like dioptre corrections. For a beginner it even has a setting with creative filters applied automatically to scene which I find to be useful.
49,3,"  It’s good for a beginner I must say not for the someone who’s looking for more features in a economical price. I wanted a Camera for a purpose of shooting YouTube and small Events. We’ll never mind we all can always have the best with the option of just a click.Five keys to take away from this experience.• Best for beginners• Not very economical for the price• Amazon has the options needed• Canon’s playing with it’s good will• Well, never mind nobody’s going to take it seriously"
50,1,"  1. Purchase date:- 14-05-2020 with one year warrantyWarranty expiry date of camera I checked from canon wedsite:- 10-12-2021The date and month should be same, That means warranty starts 6 months before the purchase date with two year warranty.2. The camera package seal was broken. both camera and lense was simply put in the box without any cover.3. Camera strap was missing.I returned the item for replacement.Here I am attaching the screenshots from the video I took while unpacking."
51,3,"  Honest Review: this canon camera is not good for beginners,, better to go for good point and shoot camera or good quality mobile bcoz when you shoot your video this will not give you any auto focus to moving object. So this will just give auto focus to a particular object only and when your object go front and back.. this get automatically blurred in case of video. This is my honest review so don't buy this camera for YouTube video like cooking, art and craft etc. You don't get return and refund so go to shop and try the camera range before buying for your particular purpose. For photography you can buy this. But for video this is the worst camera I ever used. I don't expect such a bad autofocus.. after doing manual focus settings then also this camera will stuck to that particular silent no motion,,, object only. We shoot video for moving things.. so worst buy. 1500d is totally worst for video."
52,5,"  DSLR 1500D is perfact for beginners, best quality pictures. Easy to use, using wifi communication u can easily transfer all the images in your phone, also u can use ur phone as remote control of your DSLR with a small android app canon camera connect."
53,1,  I bought a canon eos less than a week ago and the shutter stopped working. There is only one official service centre in a big city like Hyderabad and now they say that some liquid has entred they don't do free service as some liquid has entered and it is customer mistake. I did not even use it much and not sure how the liquid entered.
54,5,"  Ordered this product for Rs. 21,990/- using Prime on 22.10.2019 at 10:00PM & Received it on the Very Next Morning! Product was Packed Tight Perfectly in Sealed condition.Box contains: Camera Body, 18-55 Lens, Strap, Battery, Battery Charging Adapter & Wire, Kingston 16GB Memory Card, A Carry Case, Warranty Card and Guide.Turned it On After mounting the Lens to the body and started to Click Pictures and I must Say The Quality of the Pictures are Damn Great and Amazing. Tried Clicking some Pictures of Potraits, Close Up's and in Flash off Mode and the Results had Awestruck me!Also Connected the Camera to My Mobile Using WiFi and Canon Camera Connect App from PlayStore as this Product supports WiFi and NFC. Using Remote Access I had Controlled Camera and clicked Few Images and it seemed perfect. WoWI have Noticed that Autofocus is a Bit Slow. Will talk about this in the later part after proper utilisation.I Conclude that this is a Must buy Camera for Beginners and Hobby Photographers at a very Reasonable Price."
55,5,  Great DSLR for begeners......amazing quality ant trust of canonRecomended for all photo enthusist and normal household events and functions.Good user experience...Camera bag it came with is not that giod.....recomended to chenage it foe added safty
56,5,  Value for money. Good for beginers. I used for video recording. Max record upto 12 min. as per standards. No external mic support to record audio as it's entry level DSLR. I used previously canon 1300D which of 18 MP but it's of 24 MP which is better for photos and videos as well. More durable. Got in deal around 24000 rupee. More than happy.
57,2,"  Bought from Appario. Two orders and one replacement - seal broken in all three cases so returned the camera. Bought it for 33.5k first and now, with JJ Mehta - it is > 38k. All in 10-15 days time."
58,1,"  Please see the unboxing photos as attached along with this review. Carefully check before placing orders what you are going to get. Memory card will not be part of this. I found camera bag missing. Also SD card slot does not have the tray/container to insert a SD card, even though you buy a SD card on your own separately. Also see the picture carefully, without lens the camera will look like as shown in the picture. I wanted to capture all accessories included when I got it delivered. Conclusion: amazon FBA is not justifying with customers. Canon original product definitely has all accessories even including SD card I believe. Now I doubt about the quality of packing and condition of the camera, never know it's just an used product got delivered. Moreover, the product does not have refund policy. Be very careful before placing an order."
59,4,"  Just getting my hands on the new purchase but its really seems to be a Deceptive Trick by CANON or their dealers to show a reduced price..There is NO USB CABLE INCLUDED & NO SD CARD NOT EVEN 16GB ONE. Now it really doesn't take Einstein to understand that anybody who is willing to purchase a cam like this wouldn't care to get a necessary cable/card with it & its just so obvious that we all expect exactly that a cable/card would be included...So, before buying please do checkout the list of included items carefully...other stars after using the cam."
60,4,  Been using this for about a year now and it really works great as a DSLR is supposed to. But just reflecting back on why I bought this camera at this price I think I was better off buying a smartphone with good camera. The camera is good no doubt but the smartphone cameras have also developed alot. So buying this camera for an average person may not be the ideal choice But still it is a good DSLR for it's price. 😊
61,5,  Everything is okay in this product but i suggest seller to include SD Card and Carry bag because it's difficult to start camera without SD Card. Also bag is required in  travelling for Camera safety. Charge extra of this 2 items but next time please give those items included.
62,5,  Good for Beginners. Using this product for more than year now and working perfectly fine. Purposely did'nt wrote review earlier. Now I can say this product is really good. Amazon delivered in good way.Recommande to Beginners who are looking for good DSLR.
63,5,  Amazing camera for beginners like me. Awesome picture quality and best part is it has auto mode which will do everything we just have to click the photos. Really liked this camera.
64,5,"  was very happy for the price that i got at 19,990 during the sale. Camera works well but i did not explore all the options. Hope it's good for beginners to play around."
65,4,"  Best for beginner photography. It's been more than 6 months now. I bought this camera with the 18-55 lens for 21k and a 2k debit card discount on top (net: 19k). I have learnt a lot in terms of photography. The continuous shot speed is very less (3 fps) and the autofocus isn't that great but does the job.For the price this is a value for money camera.This is a very portable camera. With time you can upgrade your lenses.If you're are really into photography or want to explore it with a minimal budget this should be your purchaseIf you want to check out more photos from this camera and ask any queries personally, check it my Instagram id: @pixelbug_abhi"
66,5,  If you want to buy a dslr under 30k then this is probably the best choice for you.....even a good hand is enough to click pictures like professionals with this dslr....just make sure you buy a portrait lens when u buy the first extra lens with this camera....this combination of 50mm lens and canon 1500D is a beast🔥
67,4,"  You can take brilliant photos with this camera ( if you know how to use it properly)Picture quality is niceNice auto focus ( suffers during low light)The smartphone connect app is useful...Better to buy extra lens.Kit lens is not that much powerful,but you can take great photos with it,If you want.Camera is just a tool,it's all about your talent.Am completely satisfied with this productAmazon packaging was great,they took serious protective measures.Thanku Amazon, Canon , The seller and all the persons who brought this item to me."
68,5,"  super camara, picture qulity very clearly, auto focus amazing and beginners go for it blindly...5 star rating overall, very smooth and hendy camara and its lcd display cool and bright also camara easy work and fast photo capture, wife to connect mobile features i like it,. but amazon delivery so late. i order 1/10/2019 and packeg arrived 7/10/2019..  7 days for wait...not speedy prosses"
69,5,"  A pretty decent camera not only for beginners but for experienced photography enthusiasts as well. My suggestion to those who are buying their first DSLR- spend a couple of days learning / experimenting the manual mode, you'll have some awesome pictures after that. The bundled lens is good in most of the situations, low light auto-focus could be a bit better. All in all, this is a good camera at this price."
70,5,  Best for beginners.-Image quality is really crisp.-Can capture video 1080p @30FPs and 720p @60FPs. On NTSC video system.-Build quality is also good.-18-55mm lens is also fine for the beginning.-Night quality is good but do not expect that much.
71,3,  I did not receive memory card and bag with the camera. Now I am unable to test it. I can see other people have received both items along with the camera. My camera box does not have sticker mentioning the SD card. Canon should have included it.
72,1,"  They are not going to give you the carry bag which comes free with product. Even they will not give the memory card. And box are used, seal broken. Better you go and buy in shops"
73,5,  This product is best for beginners who want to come to the world of photography. I am using this camera for 2 days i am pretty satisfied with the experience and i didnt get any issues if i get some issues after using it i will be updating this revew. the lens which u getwith this camera is 18-55mm kit lens which gives descent depth of field the only problem with lens is that it can only zoom uptp 55mm long so if u want a high end lens u can buy it seperately. i have attached a picture of mine which was shot by my brother so that u can get an idea of the picture quality. overall this is one of the cheapest but best camera i have ever seen.
74,4,  Good product For begginers and if you want to good quality picturs you should buy this product . But in case if you want to make video for project so kindely notice that it has verry poor focus and if object still than you can focus properly buy if obect are moving then you'll face problems .otherwise good image quality and and good potrait photos you can capture
75,4,  I am using past 6 months and till now I am very much satisfied from this product using day light photography but I do not know what settings are required to capture night light photo.. using default auto setting. So it's drawback or my lack of knowledge. If I get setting details from product seller then fine picture quality at night then I will revise my rating.
76,5,  Nice product..my first DSLR n it is great..
77,5,"  Very Nice At This Price... I Got It At Low Price During Great Indian Festival... With Dual Lens... It's Perfect For The Beginners... I Wanna Give Thanks To The Seller... ""Appario Retail Limited"" Got It Before Our Festival Durga Puja... Battery Life Is Not So Nice... But, Good..."
78,1,  No hot shoeHave attached photos of the sameHuge Flash issueDon’t buy canon 1500D if you want to use third party flash with this camera as it doesn’t have Center hot shoe.Third party flash cost less.As a entry level camera the cost of camera is low.But You’ll be forced to buy canon flash only as only canon flash are supported and canon flash are expensive.Go for other canon models which have Center hot shoe.
79,5,"  It's my childhood dream to buy a camera. I am afraid of buying such an expensive item online. But I take a chance, and the comes with very good and safe packing. The quality of the Camera was awesome, Everything in-camera is too good. M happy with the Quality and service... Thank you"
80,5,"  It's an awesome product from the home of 'Canon'. Product is really very fine to handle. Thanks to the Amazon team.If you're a beginner, then you can go for the basic training classes through YouTube or an instructor. Functionality of the product is far interesting & a beginner should learn step by step.In the end, the product is worth for you in an unique budget. Go for it 👍"
81,5,"  I like  very much this  , image quality is vet nice First things first, it’s an incredibly functional DSLR that takes sharp images with a natural feel to them and also offers a good video quality. More importantly for beginners, however, it manages to do that right out of the box, which allows beginners to get taking great pictures and recording quality videos as soon as they unbox the DSLR."
82,1,  Poor customer supportProduct quality not upto the markMy 13000rs Sony camera which is 5 years old is far better than thisData transfer cable also missingBough it on Amazon saleBut am least happy with this productMy Samsung phone takes better pictures than this
83,5,  I can say it's a best camera for photography.This is my first dslr I bought during Amazon sale @22k. I was confused between nikon d3500 & canon 1500d after getting the amazing feedback from my photographer friends I chose to go with canon brand.This was my first shoot I did with the 18-55mm kit lense & got wonderful results. I'm looking forward to buy 1 50mm F1.4 lens to upgrade my potrait shoot.Thanks alot Amazon your service & support can never be matched!
84,3,  Amazon delivered a second hand product.The Canon Digital camera package seal  was broken and it was opened several times by previous users. The camera was with full of finger print marks. There was no provision for return of product. I am not satisfied with a second hand product with price for the original product.
85,5,"  Very beginner friendly. I bought it for my cousin  who is a complete newbie in photography. And he took this picture (attached) in his first day. The focus speed is not as good as Nikon entry levels, and the battery backup is slightly worse as well. But the color profile is much better in Canon. The details are very close to Nikon D5600. Only major negative is fixed display. But again wifi mobile  connection really helps."
86,5,  Got it for 19k during festival salesIncredible for that priceEasy to use and good picture qualityEasy to transfer photos via nfcGood battery also
87,5,  A great product for beginners. Got it for 21k during amazon sale and using sbi card cash back. Worth every penny if u really want to click your moments and cherish later. Even my wife is also much comfortable using this camera since it has screen view mode. Also the automode sets the ISO and white balance allowing clicking shots without looking for a setting if u r in a hurry. Wifi connect is very convinient. U can just download whichever image u like.
88,5,  It is best camera for beginners and both with 2 lens. Fully satisfied and got good offers while purchase.
89,5,"  For the beginner, this is a perfect choice. Also, I got a huge discount on this one on Prime day. Thanks to Amazon :)The only problem I am facing is unable to register its 2 years warranty on the canon website. However, Amazon also solved this issue by providing the same 2 years warranty on this product."
90,1,  False advertisementNo touchscreenLens doesn't do a good jobMakes too much sound while focussingNo good focus at all.Blurry videosNo flash in videos...It's my First day with this cameraAnd I'm highly highly highly disappointed.PleaseI repeat please DO NOT PURCHASE ITEVEN IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER.Else you will cry like me
91,4,"  For beginners in the photography world: The 1st thing you should do after buying a camera is understanding the concepts (shutter speed, aperture, ISO, metering etc). For this please go with some youtube videos to learn the basics.do not ever keep in auto mode and shoot. learn the things and keep in manual modes (P, Tv, Av, M). Even the ISO, do not keep in Auto for ISO. It will introduce more noise in the image."
92,5,"  A perfect camera for beginners. If you are not a professional ,this camera will suffice all your needs.Good AutofocusGreat picture quality.And best thing is remote operability from canon camera connect App. This really helps for nature photography."
93,4,"  This camera is very good for beginners.  U can go with 1500 or 3000d . But the picture quality  and video quality in 1500d is not that mark . Its auto fuces is too bad . If I r vlogger and have less bought pls get your self better mobile , this camera is not for videos. It record videos at 1080p 30 fps . 720p 50 fps . Video samples  are quit good and above average.  Go with prime lens 18 55mm lens for boke or blue background for u r photos and videos quit better then 3000d . I got this camera 20990 Rs ( sbi debit card 10% off offer )only in great Indian sale"
94,5,"  After gaining a bit of knowledge of Manual control and AV, TV modes, I am very satisfied with the camera. Highly recommended for beginners searching for entry level DSLRs."
95,5,"  I received the product on 4.10.2019. When I tried to register the product with the website of canon to get extended warranty, it is revealed that the product has already been registered on 13.06.2019. So, the warranty would expire on 12.6.2021. It is also revealed that the supplier's name is incorrect, when I entered the details of the supplier on the website of canon, which is the same as shown in the invoice. To net result is that the warranty is reduced by two and a half months. I have reason to believe that it is a used product. The vendor is expected to you answer my doubts"
96,3,"  I want to rerurn this. Internal mic quality is not good and this is not supporting for external mic also when i used 3.5 mm to 2.5 mm converterBeing a youtuber, No point of having a camera in which i can not record my voicesAmazon team us telling me to contact the seller.. to return"
97,1,  This bad camera also it is not supported with triggers and extra flash his given point is not compatible with other brands for beginners if he buy only cannon flash and trigger very costly and photo quality also bad my I phone quality is much more better then this dslr useless camera don’t waste your money I already wasted
98,5,  A budget friendly Camera for beginners.📸I bought this for 19k💰It's doesn't disappointing me😊A Great Camera for learning photography.👨‍🏫You want to learn photography then go for it.Great Picture Quality at this price range🖼
99,5,  I am a beginner. i loved the settings its easy to lean ISO and AF Settings. And i got 55 250 MM lens free with this and teh focus for that lens is awesome.. Also Stability is great. While clicking portrait pics its coming so good. Better then Iphone XR.Just one thing it makes too much sound thats it otherwise its worth buying....
100,5,"  As expected, the entry level DSLR is best for beginners. Its easy to operate. I got 18-55 lense which is good for all except zoom, only 3x. However, you have to buy a zoom lens for that purpose. Battery is also good. It lasts the whole day with continuous shooting."
101,5,"  This Camera is the King of Budget segment Cameras.This camera gives you excellent results only if you know how to use a dslr.The 55-250 lens is more reliable than 18-55.To reduce the focusing noise use stm or usm lens.Build quality is mind blowing..Used the camera for 1 year and is extremely Satisfied.Best camera for beginners and for others you can use this as a secondary camera.Battery life is decent.For New users who are not excellent in manual mode can approach youtube and learn the basics.Other modes are not useful.Use Av,Tv,M modes for photography.Video quality is poor as this is not a video camera.The Wifi Feature is handy and makes transfering of images quick.50mm Lens suits excellent for the camera.You can check my insta handle for images captured using this camera  mr.panicker__Negative:Low light photography is not impressiveProduces grains at high iso 6400"
102,5,  It's my first time DSLR very nice product.i really like it .I also inquiry before purchasing it canonn 1500d . I found Nikon 3500 vs to canonn 1500d . really it's very nice . but Amazon company delivery person very bad.he didn't delivery my mention My attitude is dependent upon the way u treat me..i will take my product another person talk with him.amazone company should be look into this matter
103,2,  The audio recording is terrible. The picture quality is not that great. Not worth it..Go for a better product
104,5,"  Main drawback is that, It does not have 3.5 mm jack for recording audio... A connector to connect its mini usb port to 3.5 mm jack should be in its accessories"
105,5,"  It is my 1st DSLR camera, and its performance is satisfactory. Its has been 2 years already since I bought it, but I must say this camera is amazing, its picture quality is very good,  easy to use, for beginners as well. I like it."
106,1,  Have not received memory card
107,5,"  One of the best camera 📸 i ever purchased.It was so reasonable price.Coming to the performance of the camera i could give 99/100 . To get more fabulous pictures you need to buy Lenses seperately.For Portrait shorts: 50mm LensFor Wildlife Photography: 75-250mm or 75-300mm is the best.Eventually all i would say that, Love this Canon 1500d Camera 📸❣️"
108,1,  Cannot attach flashgun
109,5,  Ok but not useful with basic lens provided with it...pictures are look like you are taken with mobile camera ...pic you are thinking of to taken with dslr are only comes with higher lenses you used ...either you go for 50-250 or 70-300 but basic lens 15-55 are useless.
110,1,  We have received the defective piece and it was not getting charged.... Even there is no return for it.. just a replacement on which  we dont have any trust how it would be... and more over they have shown a deal of 3000 rs less now and i want it for newer price as product was defective and want a newer one..for which the amazon customer care said that he cannot do anything...
111,2,"  DO NOT BUYCanon has tried to create monopoly through this model. Hot shoe has been changed so now only canon flash lights will  work with this model i.e. Canon eos 1500d.They have NOT even mentioned this anywhere on amazon or on their website, not even the dealers of canon know this new development.The LCD screen could have been given a flap covering which was in previous models."
112,5,"  Perfect to capture every special moments of your life..No need of expertise, camera adjust itself to capure best photos.. picture quality is awesome..battery works for 3-4hrs after fully charged. wifi function is very useful to download photos in your mobile. overall performance ia good.."
113,5,"  Some people believe that online shopping is not safe for digital items .but it's not true .I have been buying products from Amazon for 3 years. I didn't receive any of the item as damaged.It was a very big decision of mine to buy an item of heavy amount through online shopping, I was thinking that it would come damaged or broken but after receiving it I will say that it is best for normal people who use to click photos everywhere they travel as Nikon is good for the photographers .I will recommend the viewers of the product to surely buy this .👍"
114,5,  We purchased it for a gift. It really was a great deal. The best part is that it was liked by the person whom we gifted. He actually enjoys it now. The photos are sharp and usability is good.  Great product and good quality by Amazon.
115,2,"  I have been using this camera for the last 4 months, since I am a beginner I couldn't understand it properly and couldn't understand the quality of the photo, but I showed it to some pro people they said that photo sharpness is not good and blur is there in the photo I don't understand what to do nowNow again I have to show it in the service center"
116,3,"  Very bad experience of service , 45 days for after service delivery, if got the camera after 45 days for I have travel for 150 km , the camera have hanging problem from the month of perchse"
117,5,  Amazing picture quality even with the kit lense..colors are very much natural...for beginner its a very nice camera.. light weight...i wish this could have rotating LCD viewer screen but thats not an big issue..
118,4,  Best for beginners and if you are buying this for vlogging purposes i will not recommend it because it is very hard to handle without a gimbal or tripod.Picture quality is superb and video quality is good.Battery capacity is very good comparing to other models of canon.Auto focus is fine and inbuilt flash is superb.Wifi and nfc are Woking fast and no lag at all.I recommend this for professional videographers and YouTubers the most.
119,4,"  Nikon 3400 is better than 3500 so don't buy nikon 3500.But i choose canon 1500 because wifi , camera app, You definitely need extra lens. 50mm is good because i though kit lens is ok for me but believe me  you definitely need extra lens. Zoom lens is not you need so don't buy with combo lens. Go for 50 mm lens. Now one more thing"
120,4,  This Camera is worth the money but the Focus is slow and one very bad about this camera is that it doesn't have 3.5mm external mic port connection other wise picture quality with prime lens and zoom lens is awesome.
121,5,"  Good camera, but no external mic port.. if you want a camera with external voice recorder please select some other one. Without knowing this I had purchased this, even the same day return also not possible with Amazon. But camera is awesome, try to purchase with combo lense otherwise lense cost will be more."
122,2,  Not good for beginners as well as professional users. price is too high for the picture quality that this camera gives. Nikon 3500D gives great photos with blur in the background and is also best in this price range.
123,4,  Probably the Camera is Good for Beginners and Budget Price. The main problem is we can't insert microphone in the camera. Otherwise the camera is really good for the price. I have used this camera past 7 months
124,5,  This is my first CAMERA and its perfect DSL for beginners. Picture quality is awesome. Auto focus is amazing. Still in learning phase but so far I like this product very much. Soon will purchase another lens beyond 50+Lastly again before time delivery from Amazon.
125,5,"  Amazing camera. Got it in 27k with 18-55 and 55-250 lens in great india sale. Easy to handle all functions and picture quality is awsum. Easy to adjust aperture, shutter speed and ISO in manual setting. Auto setting works well. Light weight. Very good start for beginers. Go for it."
126,5,"  Very clear, loud and sharp picture. But everything depends on photographer. Very robust but light weight DSLR. You can easily carry it over a long time. A complete DSLR at a reasonable price with reputed Brand."
127,3,  I need an invoice for registering warranty! I did not recieve any invoice with the product!And the invoice button on app is not opening any invoice!
128,3,"  Product doesn't contain Memory Card and Camera carrying bag. This is not fare. Earlier review comments, I saw it was included in same package. This is very bad about this product."
129,4,  It's a great camera for biggnier. Only drawback no option for connecting external mic.
130,4,"  As a beginner in photography myself, i was suggested to buy this product by a photographer friend of mine. So far, good to practice your skills on, but definitely would suggest to move on to other better options quickly.It comes with a kit lense and a kit bag to hold the camera body, lense and batterycharger, but the holding loop of the bag got torn off on the second day !!!... That was a bit dissapointing."
131,5,  Good cameraStarted loving it and i could able to use the cam as a proAutofocus is so bad on kitlens i don't know is it same on other lensNight snaps are average and if you gys can use on manual mode you will get awesome results if it's on auto night photography is little bit badOverall it's a perfect choice for beginnersNot recommended video shooting on auto focus
132,5,"  Initially I was looking for Nikon DSLR, but went with Canon 1500D. I must say that I have made the right choice as it works like a charm, looks good and built quality is very good. Best entry level DSLR."
133,4,  Very good camera but canon is simply loosing its credebility but making silly changes in the camera to restrict this camera for professional use .This camera is not suitable for studio photography as canon has removed the the universal pin from the camera hotshoe ..Shame on canon ...
134,1,  Have received used item (item has already registered in canon website 2 months before I purchased.. have shared all proofs to amazon team) but customer care people suggesting me to contact manufacturer.. such a worest response have received.. Amazon team took time to respond mean time my return window period also completed..
135,1,  I got a useful product..it was z shock to me. And amazon..asking me to run around to get denial service letter from cannon. Very irresponsible behaviour from the buyer.
136,4,  It's worth only less than 25 k especially without camera bag/ other accessories. But some how it seems to be over priced for some reason
137,3,  Camera image quality is good. However there's one major disadvantage about canon product is unlike Nikon it only support own brand accessories like external flash which is wayyyy tooooo costly. (~12k). For beginner use it can work good but only in daylight.
138,3,"  Best camera for photography, but its not good if you wanna shoot video B'cqz auto focus not working as well as during video shoot!I had suggest you to buy a prime lens for batter portraits and low light photos!@nofeel_shaikh"
139,5,"  This is a very suitable, easy to handle DSLR camera for people who want to start out with digital photography. I was able to operate this camera very easily after learning different functionalities by watching several videos online. Strongly recommended for people with no or very little exposure to DSLR. One can always choose to buy a better lens later if they feel like upgrading the quality of the pictures."
140,1,  Very MC Product Bill is not available on this Box 😡 and memory card and battery and 55-250mm lens both are not available on this product ☹️ 😒 DON'T BUY AMAZON IS FROD
141,5,"  I'm very excited to get soon ,as I expected I received soon,TNX to Amazon fr fast n safe delivery , Amazon is most trusted fr safe n geniune products 😍🥰😘"
142,4,  Enjoying with it. Easy to operate.  But you have fixed ISOs. Not working with camera connect app on my Samsung phone.  If you neglect this than it is good for beginners. Four stars.
143,4,  Best for Beginners - Nice picture quality
144,5,"  Amazing build quality. Best camera for beginners and also for mediocre users. I belive anyone who knows basic rules of photography should buy this, you will have an amazing time with this camera, the canon mobile app also helps with the remote capture. Autofocus could have been better for subject which are really close but never the less its the best entry level camera in the world"
145,5,  The Canon 1500D is an excellent package for begineers. The controls are amazing and easy to use. The images are crisp and clear. The autofocus is also great.The only con i noticed in this product is that when we are in screen display mode for capturing images the auto focus take a lot of time to focus on the subject.Otherwise overallthe product is worth every penny.Thanks to Amazon for ontime delivery and great package.
146,5,"  Excellent product/build quality under budget price, excellent picture quality, best choice for upgrading lower priced lenses (canon 50mm).flipscreen and headphone jack for recording audio is missing."
147,1,  Its not at all user friendly. For every click you need to set the lense .Pics get blurred. There is no one to help or support.Helpline no is not responding. I tried to register the product but couldnt do till date.Canon has third class products and services
148,5,"  Budget DSLR. Photo qualities of flowers are awesome. But normal photography is average equivalent to good quality images of photo captured from most of the mobile phone except pixels.Clearity is good which can't be available in most of the image captured from mobile ..there is no in built image effect. So image u will get will be original.So it can be tried. But if u have budget,I will guggest better to go for higher version ."
149,5,  Am using DSLR for the first time.I can able to use the camera with ease and can change the option without complexity.Picture quality is quite good for the price range.If you are newbie in photography this better suits you.All the best!.
150,5,"  It is best for daylight shoots not perfect for night shoots........... It is used for the beginner because I am also a beginner....With modeling, you pose. You want to look your best all the time. With acting, you have to be aware of the camera, but the more you show your imperfections, the better you're going to be."
151,5,"  Hey there, I am just a beginner so not going to deep. Definetly as a beginner I feel very comfartable using this camera. Autofocus is enough if you are not shooting moving pictures.If you use in manual mode and keep the perfect settings you will get the best result. For the price this is the best you can expect. And as I said I am a beginner and learning photography. So if I pointed anything wrong please apologize."
152,5,  Best camera for beginners and short film makers. Camera is very well packed and it looks awesome. The user manual is very useful for first time buying people. Zoom lens is awesome. And the carrying bag is also very good. I really liked the product and it give me a better experience. Thank you canon and also Amazon 🙏
153,4,"  Bought this camera for about 23000.The camera was packed pretty well.The camera is really good for beginners.Some people say the kit lens is bad but I feel you can get some pretty decent shots once you learn how to use it.The auto focus is not that good so I recommend you use the manual focus,just to get your perfect shot.one of the reasons I bought this camera is because of the wifi function.It works really well and it is convenient ."
154,1,"  I ordered Canon EOS 1500D from Amazon and guess what, there is a missing Camera bag and merory card in the box. And box was sealed properly when I got in my hand"
155,5,  Great product and great service by the seller. The seller has helped me out to resolve a glitch I had and I am really grateful to him. The seller followed up and made sure that I had a good experience with the transaction I made with him
156,5,  Too good picture quality. For beginners it is so good. If u want to purchase a digi cam and don't want much money ot be invest you can go for it.
157,5,  I use it mainly for print photography and it is very easy to use and captures very accurate images. I am more than happy with the purchase and at current price it is excellent value for money.
158,5,  Nice camera for dslr beginner's
159,5,  I was waiting for this one.. Since a long time.. When the 1200D model was popular.. Then 1300D.. But i waited too long to own this camera.. Finally i got 1500D by amazon with a great offer @28k.. U ll get 2 lenses and a carry case and all that u want.. U can simple start photography..
160,4,  The camera is great for beginners who have just stated to learn but the features are slightly complex for understanding. If you have ever used a Nikon camera..I would suggest you buy Nikon because the transition can be little uneasy. But the camera in itself is very good. I have used this camera in limited scenarios but experienced so far is great.
161,5,"  Pros-Best for beginners. Best deal worth 19,950 with EF-S 18-55 lense+ focal earphones worth 1999 MRP with this deal.Cons- it support onlt Cannon external flash which is a costly product. Other cameras supports other make flashes  starting ₹2500"
162,5,  Go for it if u get a good dealPros1 cannon best lenses support2 WiFi connectivity for sharing3 ease of useCons1 not as user friendly as 34/3500 D2 bulky
163,5,  It's a good night have to choose for beginners and it is very nice use package was very safe and because of a good 19 impact it was late delivery. Camera is very useful to beginners like me. And well set about the building quality quality is very nice CE and pretty good to view good to see that also. The image taken by the camera is very clear and it is a budget camera for beginners
164,5,  This is a great camera for not only beginners but also amateur photographers. Often what matters is how well you know your camera and since this is a user-friendly camera it is worth considering!
165,1,  I recently bought this camera night mode pics are really coming blurr and shaky.pickels also not clear only in night mode.pls help me to find the right mode or replace this one because I think it's a problem. After my purchase price went down to 21000 which is highly disappointing
166,5,  very nice dslr camera with good quality picfures and very good video quality. i recomend everyone to buy this dslr camera.
167,1,  Only used photosgraphyNot for record video autofocus vary badNo 9 point autofocus only 1 autofocus point
168,4,"  This is the best Camera for Beginners. You can learn Manual Mode easily, UI is good and user friendly. Search for videos on YouTube to get best out of it."
169,5,  The best DSLR at the starting price range. It has just the right amount of settings for beginners to learn the perks of a DSLR. The video and snaps quality is also too good.
170,1,"  Highly disappointed with the problems I'm facing with the camera, the flash of the camera stops working and start showing error 50. Restarted many times but the problem remained same."
171,5,  My first DSLR loving it....  but don't underestimate this camera it gonna wow you if used correct lens
172,5,"  Good camera. Very easy to handle for a beginner. With a good lens, it would juz do wonders for the price range. I have used basic Nikon also, but never felt this easy."
173,5,  It's my DREAM CAMERA. I love it. I feel fantasy with it. I like it very very. It's my precious purchase. No word for this product. I feel high level thrill really I can not explain for it's quality.thanks.

175,5,"  Well i found the product authentic after buying it from amazon, entry level 📷, for photography enthusiasts good product for starters. I bought the camera in very reasonable price (great India shopping)."
176,1,  I got defective lens and no buddy is helping me
177,5,  Best dslr camera manufactured by Cannon for begginers... EOS 1500D...using it for 2 years no issue till date...
178,4,"  There is no invoice for the Canon Camera , either with the box or under My Orders in Amazon App. So I cannot warranty for product - how can I buy electronics from Amazon ?"
179,4,"  It's more suitable DSLR camera for beginners. It's got great auto focus and couple of modes for varied kind of shots. Also it has benefit of wireless picture snapping via NFC/Mobile app, which can also live view the picture taken and transfer the pictures/videos on the go."
180,5,  Great DsLR for beginners !
181,2,"  No digital memory card with the purchase, even thou it was enlisted. Too costly."
182,5,"  This is perfect for a beginner. Very affordable, handy,amazing picture clarity. Got charger, sd card and carry bag free with the camera."
183,4,  Good product to start your hobby or to explore your photography skills in style loaded with cool features.Got it during sale and value for money.
184,1,"  Out of my experience, Felt like OnePlus phone camera is better than this DSLR.Waste of money . We have kept this dslr in a corner of my home"
185,5,"  Very good for beginnersAutofocus is not very good as it has only 9 af pointsThe screen is also not moveableCompact and user friendlyLightweightThe raw file is in CR2 format which is not easy to open and edit in simple softwareNikon D5600 is also in the same line you can buy but has less megapixel, but high af points and moveable screen"
186,3,  If you are going with this camera then fine but you can't use third party additional flash light you have to bought canon flash which is costing more than 20000 so I prefer if you want to use it with additional so don't buy it otherwise for normal purpose at-home it is fine
187,5,"  I received the product in very good condition and the product is excellent for beginners. If you know the use of different lens, the camera is awesome. If the the lens cost are bi lower side, we may buy different lens to explore more.One can buy this product form Amazon as I have purchased many products which I have received in good condition.All the best"
188,5,                    The media could not be loaded.                   64 GB memory card is missing.
189,5,"  Who want learn photo shoot, YouTube video shooting, very useful and low price camera, good branded model and company product.. thank you Amazon"
190,4,"                    The media could not be loaded.                   Not Bad Not Good Just Avarage For 23,999 price single kit lence. But Light weight and Good."
191,4,  This is a very good product for beginners at this price. I got this for 22k in amazon when there was a one day deal. It is so far so good. Excellent product if would just like to use it for small family parties and gatherings.
192,5,"  Perfect for beginners. I would advise it, got lucky during the sale. Got a good bargain deal on the camera and 1 lense. bag + 16 gig memory card. Product is friendly to use and easy to maintain."
193,5,  Amazing product. I get appreciation for every picture I take and all of it should go to the camera. Beginners like me can use this with absolute ease. Photo transfer to photo or laptop is made so simple that it can happen in few minutes... Excellent product.
194,5,  It's easy to know about all setting... I also don't know about photography and how to use camera but still in 4 to 5 days i learn mainly every thing from this camera... It's very helpful for beginners and their autofocus or picture quality was so nice.... But some time in manual mode it create more time to click a picture.
195,5,  The package reached me safe with good packing. It is an original product. It came with bill and warranty card.. Nice product.. A very good camera in this price range for beginners. The picture quality is fine. If this is your first DSLR you can blindly choose this.
196,5,  This camera named canon 1500D I bought from amazon is completely a basic level camera. It has overall every features a beginner needs and 2ndly it has guide with it which is very much helpful for beginners in every steps .
197,4,  I brought this camera without telephoto lens because I believe I won't click nature portraits. I believr buying canon 50mm lens will do magic. Using aperture priority mode now and learning to use. Will post review after a month.
198,5,"  Basic DSLR, You can learn all the tricks with this...Quality is so good. Auto Focus and other things are also good.."
199,5,  Just best in class..Can't compare this one from others.A must buy for beginners.Obviously better than 1300d.
200,5,"  As a beginner I really liked this camera, I used Nikon 3300 before, but this one is simple awesome. Got it in  a deal and delivery was just outstanding received in <24 hrs without prime."
201,5,  Picture quality is too good... Being an amateur i like how easy it is to use... Still a lot to learn... Battery life is good as well... Charge once to the fullest and came back from a three day trip to shillong... And it is still going on
202,5,"  Perfect beginner level dslr, met its pixel quality. I have used it for an year now and its the best if you are new to dslr's. Good battery, best lens and top camera. The body's is a bit heavy,but best at this price."
203,2,"  Auto focus of camera is pathetic, image quality is quite good but object finder doesn't work well,better to buy canon 200d, no external audio recording option."
204,5,"  If you are a beginner go for it .The auto focus is just fine, speaking about picture quality the 24 mp works fine even in low light"
205,4,  Really good DSLR for beginnersOnly downside is the Canon app which doesn't help in transferring videos wirelessly
206,1,"  I recived product on time, but when I opened packege was not intact . Seal was broken of camera box.This should not expected from Big Brand like Amazon.This happened second time with me."
207,5,  First dslr.. Extremely happy with the purchase...! Cheap and best...! Got it at 19k in an offer..!
208,5,"  The camera is perfect for an amateur photographer. The auto focusing is smooth and of quality. The body is lite as well which helps in taking quality pictures. The controls are a bit confusing, especially the menu. However, an enthusiastic person will be able to figure the controls out pretty easily. All in all, it's a fabulous product"
209,5,"  Good camera for beginners, picture and video quality is good ,  I am using it for making  youtube videos. Very good product at this low cost."
210,5,  Everything is Good But You should buy without any lens and get the new model STM Lens which has Digital Focus..Avoid IS ii Lens which comes with these model..Autofocus missed in Videomode..so it's not suitable for Gimbels
211,5,  Excellent camera for beginner and very handy during our Australia tour
212,4,"  HelloThis camera is v good for beginners and lots to learn to shoot at first sight and picture quality is at satisfaction level, not bad at all.For anyone to Buy decent DSLR at low price with quite good spec and good pictures to focus on ,consider to be one of your choice ."
213,5,"  best priced DSLR in while lot. go for it. tough i am not much into photography and bought this for personal use only, its very compatible for all kind of photography as far as i know. 5 star for pricing."
214,5,  It looks like higher end dslr feels good in hands and i love canon. Picture quality is very good more then my expectation. In low light also it performs well i like canon 1500d 😍.
215,1,  Picture quality is not good my mobile Camera pics are much better than photos taken from this camera
216,4,  Amazing Photos for beginners photography.Nice features.Light weight.1300D is also a Good Option.
217,5,  The product received was sealed and brand new. Also received it before time. Thanks to Amazon for price and delivery.
218,3,                    The media could not be loaded.                
219,2,  Better Add Some money and buy Canon 200D or make videos from your mobile.
220,4,  Good:1) autofocus2) battery backup3) operating4) wifi connectivity5) weightBAD:1) picture quality is ok not much good
221,1,  Not Good For Begineers. Not able to autofocus while shooting videos. the picture quality is just okay. Nikon point & sooot camera is better than this.
222,4,"  Product is awesome. Picture Quality is great with 24mp camera.if u want more background blur then uneed to purchase the canon 55m f/1.8  stm lens, connect with this camera and enjoy it."
223,3,  Got in offer at 20k18 - 55 lense and camera body A Focal earphone was also free with this.That was a good deal.
224,1,  Seal was already open and the price of the product drastically decreased in one day after my purchase and one of the lens is not working properly and i am not happy with the seller... Guys don't go for it...... Seller is not genuine... Product seal was already opened....
225,5,"  Being a beginner myself, the camera is an excellent option for those who are just stepping into the creative art of photography as it can give them all the tools needed to harness their skills."
226,4,  In time and safe delivery by amazonGood camera by canon for beginersThe auto focus works very goodOverall 4 stars can be given for this
227,5,  awesome camera in this price range
228,4,"  To start with...came in good packaging, it’s Digital slr camera, brownie points to the technology, wifi, lithium batteries. It’s good for beginners, easy to handle."
229,4,  It's good if you never used a nikon camera... Especially the lens is not upto the standard of nikon.. The wifi connectivity is really good
230,4,  Easy to capture. Easy to carry. Less expertise needed.
231,4,  Got it at only rs18990. Camera is very good with some minor flaws.ProsExcellent picture quality. ( It depends on the person Using it). First learn to use its settings.Easy transfer through wifi.Good build quality.Cons :Autofocus is slow.Lowlight images are not upto the mark.Not suitable for video.
232,1,  No memory card no  carry bag no internal memory
233,5,"  Easy to use, good grip. Good choice for beginners."
234,4,"  This camera is good but lens is good,Just okNot value for money..."
235,5,"  Unbelievable picture quality for the price, just become familiar with the camera once you are set you might have to adjust shutter speeds for low light but all in all great for beginners, but if you are getting it for blogging or YouTube spend 12k extra and get 200d it will be more apt for you and it also has dual pixel auto focus for fast moving objects"
236,4,  This camera is great for beginners. The default lens is good for initial practice but this camera will work best with lens having focalength greater than 50 mm. Overall nice product to begin with in the field of photography.
237,5,  Attached snapshots taken from Canon 1500D
238,4,  Just don't expect very fast af from this one (which I did). The camera is a good one but the lenses make some noise while autofocusing and sometimes you'd prefer to use the manual focus. This 1500d is absolutely not for shooting videos. Picture quality is average. I bought it with the 50mm and it's okay. Anyways it's gud for beginners. Attached some pics I clicked of and a portrait of my friend.
239,5,  Nice one😎  canon 1300 d and 1500d are the best cameras for beginners available now at market. Compared to Sony and Nikon it’s simple and not much confusing (for beginners )
240,5,  It was delivered on time and the packing was great. Easy to use as well.
241,5,  This is my first DSLR camera and I am enjoying so far.Good for beginners !Picture quality so natural colors and sharing canon app with mobile is very good
242,5,  i am no professional and this was the first time for me owning a DSLR. Packaging was good and delivery was good too
243,1,  How can u send a product which is already registered 6 months back? How can someone register without opening the product. This means it's used waste product right
244,5,"  I tried this product with the normal lens.its good for the beginners, loving photography.good product.valye for the money .Easy to use."
245,5,"  Very nice camera, good for beginners.Useful for in-house, nature, functions, and spare time photography. Take high quality pics, videos , portrait, landscape wildlife, nature pics etc Good Product who are really have passion for photography"
246,5,  What a Briliant camera it is😎😎.. Thanks to canon and amazon to bring this camera at a very good price.... Surprising camera ouput..... Thank you AMAZON....
247,4,"  no camera bag, no memory cardit came with default 18-55 lens and shoots the okay images with kit lens.paired it with 50mm prime lens to get better results"
248,3,  This is exclusively for beginners. Pictures are clear on the day light compares to indoor pics. This is not at all recommended for nature photographers.
249,5,"  Excellent Camera with Auto Focus. Easy to shoot pictures with no efforts. A quality camera for Beginners. Wait for Great India Festival, You will get massive discounts."
250,5,  Nice product for beginners.
251,5,"  Very good quality photos getting from 24.1px, really good start for beginners. Easy to handle, wifi is advantages. Price is little bit high."
252,1,  Required Software Development kit for this not provided Cameras are useless for me without SDK.Pls provide
253,5,  Good for learning photography. Go through the online video tutorials for photography. Canon settings are minimal and easy to understand the basic concepts of photography. Most professional photographers use Canon. Canon 1500D will be the top notch for entry level DSLR.
254,4,  Auto mode is really nice except for flash but I bought it for 24k so in this price just go for it
255,5,  I think this is best product for beginners. Great shoot captured yet. Some samples attached. For further shoots u can follow me on Instagram © IamHemantSoni
256,5,  Loving it. Really a great buy at this price point. Brought a 50mm canon which is giving awesome results. Really a great product for the begginers. Its really easy to use. Satisfactory for low light photography.
257,2,  I had bought this canon eos 1500d dslr during sale and got it for around 27000 and was quite happy till i got the package which only include th camera and lens18-55mm and no memory card and no carry bag
258,5,  Thanks to Amazon prime. I got it delivered next day. Packing was awesome. I am learning to use the camera. Tried some feature. Picture quality is good. May be I need to go for some lens. But what ever I received is good.
259,5,"  For a beginner, the camera is great. The additional lens is also very good.The bag is not that great, but good enough for basic use.Thanks for the bag."
260,1,  Don't buy any item from Amazon.It's is fraud. I receive short item. They have no solution for that. Bill amount not match with my order in bill invoice. Over DSLR camera is good.
261,5,  Best camera For Dental photography
262,5,  Very nice Camera for beginers Photography its not good for videography because auto focus is very low. But according to the price range it's very good. I recomend begeinners for Photography. It's such a wounderful camera with Low Price!
263,5,  MeritsGood picture quality.Best price.Easy to click still photos.Easy to gandle and share pictures.DemeritsNot suitable for shooting instant videos.Heavy . You look like a photographer when u keep it.
264,5,  this is my first dslr and im very happy for having it.it comes with enough features which every beginner needs.but 1 thing to  dislike is  it does not support any local external flash gun...like sonia digitek..godox.........only canon's original flashgun works with it. which is worth 16k....
265,5,"  Excellent for beginners, better than competitor brand interms of User friendly interface. Sharing picture via wifi makes it too handy"
266,4,  All things are good except the data cable which is not present in the box. Seller need to mention all accessories list in the bill.
267,4,"  I bought this camera yesterday for a great deal, I received perfect brand new camera with all the accessories. Judging by thousands of positive reviews here and from YouTube vloggers I think this is one of the best entry level dslr for beginner like me. Thank you amazon"
268,2,  For long distance it doesn't work
269,5,  Best and budged DSLR for the beginners. I like it's Autofocus and portrait mode.
270,3,"  I didn't got camera beg & memory card, very big disappointment for 36k"
271,4,"  For BeginnersBudget friendly camera, only for photography not for videography."
272,1,  Very bad not purchase through Amazon. Memory card not with this camera.
273,5,  One of the best  at this price
274,5,"  It is a thoroughly impressive camera. Its high-res 24.1MP sensor captures images with incredible detail. With swift burst shooting, top-notch high ISO performance, fast AF, Real-Time Eye AF tracking.. best for beginner.."
275,3,  This product supplied by krishna infotech is not up to the mark and not worth the value for money paid. The battery of the product gets heated very quickly even after very less use.
276,5,                    The media could not be loaded.                   Great experience
277,4,  Good to bigginers learn 👌
278,5,  Autofocus of kit lens isn't enough for Macro photography.However the performance is awsome if one is well versed with Manual settings
279,2,  Products is not good I take better pictures form my mobile camera camper to this stupid stuff
280,5,  It’s always feels great when I hold canon camera in hands..!! Really having a good time spending in snapping my favourites.. it’s been a month after purchasing this little champ.. feels awesome 📷
281,2,"  I purchased an Amazon camera four days ago. When I unlocked it, I found that the camera bundle didn't include the memory card. I have no idea where to complain. Feel like this is cheating!"
282,3,"  Superb camera for beginners, all I noted is noise in the images whatever the setting are, there is always a considerable amount of noise."
283,5,  Great camera for beginners to begin with!! Self explanatory features and also helps in understanding various modes!!! A true beginner's camera 😍
284,5,  Nice camera with good pictures quality. Easy to use for beginner's.
285,4,  Excellent productImages are sharp and clearBest for beginnersClick nice photos even in low lightOnly conc. Is that it doesn’t have autofocus in Video mode
286,3,  In description box content is Written 6 but I only got 5 - camera body - 18-55 lena - battery - charger - charger cabelOne item is missing i.e sd card
287,4,  Well I'm satisfied with this product.but it takes more time in auto focus.very suits good for the beginners.i won't recommend for professionals.but with the kit lens u will be disappointed.so for sure buy 55-250 lens.
288,5,  Good camera . Have good picture quality . Best photo experience
289,5,  Ideal for beginners.Just adjust the ISO and shutter speed and u r all set. If u don't know about ISO just set to Auto mode and click. Cons:No dedicated video button
290,2,  Dont buy this blindly.  Ut doesn't have 3.5 mm Jack. For video recording you have to buy external audio recorder.
291,4,  Best entry level basic DSLR Camera with less deal price on Amazon & good results. Thanks Amazon .Only Demerit of DSLR seems to be lagging of Date Time Stamp option on photos .
292,5,"  Its jus awsone,just go for it.picture quality is so good in day nd night.worth for money.Easily handel ,loved it."
293,4,  Very nice product. Value for money. Good for beginners. Satisfied with the product.

295,1,  Memory card and Camera bag is missing. Beware of this.
296,5,  Auto focus is very good and also picture qualitg is good.
297,1,  The product is good but the battery charger is not getting charged. So returned the product. But it takes lot more effort to return the product as amazon support dnt respond fast.
298,4,  Good product for beginners. Creative auto focus is best mode to click photos if you don't have much knowledge of photography.
299,1,  For tech illiterates like me please write in bold that this camera cannot record sound and neither can an external mike be used in this model. Please don't buy this camera if you intend to record videos.
300,3,  Camera is okay. However the kit lens is very poor.
301,5,"  Amazing camera for beginners. Auto focus takes time when using display, but is faster when using eye piece. Video quality is good too"
302,5,"  1) Pictures quality is osm for general use like social media photography,family functions2)Very Easy to use3)Nice Built Built quality4)worth for money5) Only one this is disappointing is that carry is not in good quality"
303,2,"  External flash is not working in this model, i tried simpex, digitek....etc"

309,4,  It is only closeup shorts cant use ordinary external  flash. Only use ttl flash it too costly.
310,5,  Got a good deal from Amazon on its prime day and the product was delivered on the next day. It was safely delivered and the product is capturing the moments with great clarity and auto focus.. good DSLR for the starters....
311,5,"  Good quality and the technology, u can share ur pics taken instantly to ur device using the wifi option. Nothing bad about the product to say only need to learn a lot to use it."

313,5,"  Best camera for beginners,the picture quality is good and handy. Very smooth function & lens zooming are very smooth to handle.Highly Suggestion for beginners 😎"
314,4,  I got this camera in unsealed packing...it seems someone tried to open it...I didn't expect this type of packing of an expensive thing
315,4,  Really good entry level Dslr for beginners its a great photography but if u r looking for video camera  its not for u.
316,1,  Very poor quality...and no return available....customer care refuse to return but at the time of purchase return facility available

318,4,  I got it for 19.5k during prime day sales.value for money.Recommended for beginners.
319,5,  Everything is good.
320,2,  I hate the battery of this camera. The battery backup is very poor. When you go for a trip you need to carry extra battery for this camera. Very disappointing
321,5,  The price at which I got on basis of it I can give it 5 star though. Rest all I must is of what a beginner needs to start with less spending which this delivers by 200%
322,5,"  A good demo required if a beginner is buying this. It’s a bit heavier than the basic camera model of this brand. Quality of delivery, packaging and product was very good."
323,4,  Nice
324,5,"  Camera received good condition, But bag not included this is the disappointment"
325,5,"  Loved this product.Although it is a bit on the cheaper side , but still manages to capture some wonderful shots. Here are some samples with my 55-250 mmr lens."

341,5,"  Really nice camera ,wish the pricing was a little less I got it for 34999 . Camera bag is not good at all ,I'm unhappy about the bag. You can go for Amazon basics camera bag available for 1899 ."

403,5,  Great product. Value for money.
404,5,"  Auto focus is crap. Otherwise it's a great camera, especially entry level and for beginners."
405,5,"  Wanted a decent camera within budget, though the 55-250 havenot been of any use at, if would have known this before could have save few thousands. but the camera and the basic lens is all a beginner wants. Should go for it."
406,5,  After one month use.i am writing a review.its amazing.picture quality is great.i got a one battery.battery backup also amazing.its very nice camera.and also great Amazon service.
407,4,"  Good camera for beginners,use manual focus which is better than autofocus on this... good image quality.."
408,4,  Canon 1500D is best suited for begginer and I received the product in the second day of my order.The price is affordable for the facility offered.It support auto focus and the lens can also be changed.It also support NFC and WIFI.
409,5,"  The camera has nice auto focus mode and amazing picture quality. However the lens 18-55 is basic, so I recommend if you buy this product, buy with 55-250mm lens too."
410,5,  Great DSLR camera for shot film. Easy to handle as well as light weight.
411,4,"  I bought this product at a price of 18.5k at this price its an Excellent product for the bigginers, and the quality of the picture is amaizing."
412,5,  Very good product. Good for beginners to learn. Bought it in rs 25990
413,5,"  Super picture quality offers price (19,990)"
414,5,  It's great camera for begginer. Image quality is also good. But I want to suggest you to purchase 50mm canon lens for best portrait photography.
415,4,"  It's an amazing product from cannon camere series,Useful for in-house, nature, functions, and spare time photography. Take high quality pics,Picture quality is ausom.👍🏻👍🏻"
416,5,"  For begginers this is one of the best camera all options are really handy and accessable, this could be easily changed with ISO, Appature and Shutter speed. Yes being a begginer I am too much confident on this 1500D and I just love it."
417,5,"  It's full value for the money.  I purchased it at Rs.  21,500. It is far better than mobile cameras and tiny digital cameras.  There is a vast difference in pics."
418,5,  The camera itself is awesome. I liked the interface for canon cameras. The only con i found was regarding the auto focus. It has got only 9 auto focus point but manual focusing can be easily done. Beginner just go for it.
419,5,  Camera is very good and easy to handle. It functions well. Good product at this price level. For beginners it has many functions n all works good.
